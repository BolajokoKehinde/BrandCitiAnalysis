# Analysis of Relox customer Interaction and Purchase

This is a analysis report for Relox customer interaction and purchases for the year 2006

I worked on a project making use of Power BI where I created a dashboard to display the analysis report for Relox customer interactions and purchases for the year 2006.
Here are my key insights and recommendations:

KEY INSIGHTS:

- Quantity by Gender: Females purchased the highest quantity in 2006.
- Customer Count by Month: March had the highest customer count.
- Product Returns by Category: Books and clothing had the highest return rates.
- Product Price by Category: Clothing and books had the highest product prices.
- Quantity by Product Category: Clothing and books had the highest quantity purchased.
- Total Purchase by Payment Method: Credit card was the most used payment method.
- Customer Count by Payment Method: Most customers used credit cards.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Focus advertising on females  since they had the highest purchases.
2. Offer sales in off-peak months to encourage purchases and increase awareness.
3. Promote other products more to reduce returns and increase customer interest.
4. Increase the production of products beyond clothing and books after raising awareness.
5. Expand and promote alternative payment methods to customers.
